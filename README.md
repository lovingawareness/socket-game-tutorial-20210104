## Purpose

To demonstrate to myself a barebones, proof-of-concept of how to coordinate actions and timed sessions between clients. Using this to build towards the timed game rounds with user input for the Proto Payoff game. 

Once I get this to a basic state, I'll branch off of this code to explore ideas.
